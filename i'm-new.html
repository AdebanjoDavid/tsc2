          We are thrilled to have guests visiting in every service. You will find people from all walks of life and
          backgrounds

          God-honoring music
          and heartfelt, practical preaching from the Bible, we trust that you will find a church that glorifies God,
          grows
          together, and goes to others.

        <p>We pray that the Word of God comes alive for you as you listen to solid and practical Bible preaching.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <h2>The Music</h2>
        <p>We seek to exalt God through singing. It’s okay if you don’t know the songs – we didn’t either when we first
          started
          attending!</p>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <h2>The Invitation</h2>
        <p>After the message, all are invited to pray. Some will come forward to pray at the altar while some pray in
          their seat.</p>
        <p>Please feel welcome to come with any needs or questions you may have.</p>

        <p class="answer" id="answer2">Most people first attend the Sunday worship service at 10:00 am where they enjoy
          a warm welcome, inspiring music of
          soloists, ensembles, instrumentalists and congregational music, and a message from God's Word. The music
          begins the
          service and is always followed by a clear and applicable Bible message. The entire service is a little over
          one hour
          in
          length. Of course, you are invited to arrive early and stay late to enjoy fellowship and coffee with friends.

        <p id="answer1" class="answer">Children's Church is held each Sunday at 10am. This class is fun, friendly, and
          Bible-centered. It is staffed with
          friendly, and qualified teachers and helpers who will make church exciting and memorable for your child. They
          will come
          home singing new songs, quoting verses they have memorized, displaying their crafts, and sharing with you
          important
          truths they are learning from the Bible. They will learn things like the importance of obedience, being kind,
          sharing,
          and even more important truths, like who Jesus is, and the fact that God loves them and made them for a unique
          purpose.

          “Sunday
          attire". We promote the idea that church is where we meet and worship the Lord, so you will find here others
          dressed
