      <p class="h2">are you good enough for heaven?</p>
      <p class="intro">Do you consider yourself to be a good person? Most people do. But are you good enough to get to
        Heaven? Here are a few
        questions to help you figure out the answer:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Have you ever told a lie? What do you call someone who has lied to you?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Have you ever used God’s name in vain? Using God’s name to express disgust is call blasphemy in God's Word.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Have you ever stolen anything (regardless of its value)? What do you call someone who has stolen something?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Have you ever looked with lust? Jesus said, “whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed
            adultery with
            her already in his heart.” (Matthew 5:28)
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="intro">
        Yikes! And this is just 4 of the 10 commandments! If God were to judge you by His 10 Commandments on Judgment
        Day, would
        you be innocent or guilty? If you have done these things, God sees you as a lying, thieving, blasphemous,
        adulterer at
        heart, and remember that’s just four of the Ten Commandments. Even if you are guilty of breaking just one law,
        consider
        what the Bible says in James 2:10, “For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is
        guilty of
        all.” You see, God’s law is not a checklist to see how good we are, it is a checklist to reveal our sinfulness
        before
        God. Galatians 2:16 tells us, “…that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus
        Christ,
        even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works
        of the
        law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.”
      </p>
      <p class="intro">
        The Bible warns that if you are guilty on Judgment Day you will justly end up in Hell. “For the wages of sin is
        death...” (Romans 6:23) If you work a job, you expect your wages, right? Your wages are what you have earned for
        your
        work. The same is true for sin. We have earned death because of our sin against God. That’s bad news! But the
        word
        “Gospel” means “Good News” are you ready to hear some Good News?
      </p>
      <p class="intro">
        Here’s the good news, God loved you enough to send His son to suffer and die on the cross for guilty sinners.
        “...God
        commendeth [demonstrated or proved] his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners Christ died for us.”
        (Romans
        5:8) We were the ones that were supposed to die, but Christ died for us! We broke God’s Law, but Jesus paid our
        fine.
        God can now forgive us if we accept His provision. “...The gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ…”
        (Romans
        6:23)

        Imagine being in a courtroom and being found guilty of 10 different crimes. The judge, if he is good, will
        demand
        justice to be served and a penalty to be paid, right? Well, God is a good judge and because He is good,
        righteous
        judgment must be met. The penalty must be paid. Now, imagine that you are being led out of the courtroom to
        spend life
        in prison without parole. You are hopeless, but just then a stranger steps into the courtroom, and pays your
        penalty.
        How would you feel toward that stranger? You'd like to get to know him right? Well, that stranger was Jesus, and
        2,000
        years ago he paid for your sin on the cross of Calvary. God’s righteousness has been met and now you can be
        free!

      <p class="h2">Serving god is as simple as <span class="abc">ABC</span></p>
      <p class="int"><span>A -</span> Agree with God that you have broken His law and have sinned.</p>
      <p class="int"><span>B -</span> Believe that Jesus Christ alone (His death, burial and resurrection) is the only
        way you can be forgiven. (Not your
        baptism, communion, church membership, good deeds, etc.)</p>
      <p class="int" id="h2"><span>C -</span> Call on the Lord Jesus Christ and express your trust in Him today for your
        forgiveness.</p>
      <p class="intro">
        Can you sincerely pray something like this: "Lord Jesus, I believe that You died for my sin, and that You rose
        again
        from the dead. I know that I am a sinner, and I ask You now to be my Savior and Lord of my life. I'm placing my
        trust
        for forgiveness in You alone, and I accept Your gift of eternal life. Amen." If so, what's stopping you from
        making the
        greatest decision you could ever make?
      </p>
      <p class="intro">
        You'll never regret making this decision. If you have just trusted Christ, we would love to know about your
        decision and
        give you a Bible and some other materials to help you learn more about your new relationship with God. <a
