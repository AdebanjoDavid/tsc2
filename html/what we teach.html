          <h2>The The Bible</h2>
          <p>We believe that the Holy Bible was written by men supernaturally inspired; that it has truth without any
            admixture of
            error for its matter; and therefore is, and shall remain to the end of the age, preserved and the only
            complete and
            final revelation of the will of God to man. We believe the Masoretic Text of the Old Testament and the
            Textus Receptus
            of the New Testamentâ€”by their traditional acceptance and preservation by New Testament churches, to be the
            inerrant,
            infallible Word of God. For reasons of unity within the church and textual reliability we choose to use the
            King James
            version of the Bible since it is based solely on these texts.

          <h2>God</h2>
          <p>
            We believe in one God, who is eternal, self-existent, infinite, and immutable. We believe He has one nature,
            one
            essence, and one substance, yet manifests Himself to man in three persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy
            Spirit. All
            three equal in every divine perfection, and executing distinct but harmonious offices in the great work of
            redemption.

            <h2>The Holy Spirit</h2>
            <p>
              We believe that the Holy Spirit is a divine person; equal with God the Father and God the Son and of the
              same nature;
              that He was active in the creation; that in His relation to the unbelieving world He restrains the evil
              one until God's
              purpose is fulfilled; that He convicts of sin, of judgment and of righteousness; that He bears witness to
              the Truth of
              the Gospel in preaching and testimony; that He is the agent in the New Birth; that He seals, endues,
              guides, teaches,
              witnesses, sanctifies and helps the believer.

            <h2>Creation</h2>
            <p>
              We believe in the Genesis account of creation, and that it is to be accepted literally, and not
              allegorically or
              figuratively; that man was created directly in God's own image and after His own likeness; that man's
              creation was not a
              matter of evolution or evolutionary change of species, or development through interminable periods of time
              from lower to
              higher forms; that all animal and vegetable life was made directly and God's established law was that they
              should bring
              forth only "after their kind".

              We believe the church began with the calling out of the twelve apostles by Jesus Christ and was empowered
              on the day of
              Pentecost. We believe the local church is composed of members who have been saved and baptized according
              to the command
              of Christ, and have voluntarily united together for the purposes of worship, fellowship, service, and the
              Lord's Table.
              We believe all true believers, regardless of their church affiliation, will be taken up at the Rapture,
              just prior to
