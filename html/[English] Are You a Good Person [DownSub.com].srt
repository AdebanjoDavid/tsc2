00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:01,920
Living Waters presents:

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,620
Are You A Good Person?

3
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,620
Featuring Mr. Nice Guy

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,280
Meet Mr. Nice Guy.

5
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:11,719
You think you are nice?

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,900
This guy is REALLY nice.

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,080
Mr. Nice Guy: Well, I try to do
what is right.

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,960
He is so nice that if good people get to Heaven,

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,740
he will be the first in line!

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,080
Mr. Nice Guy: Aw, shucks.

11
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,860
So, Mr. Nice Guy, have you kept the Ten
Commandments? 

12
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:27,780
Mr. Nice Guy: Pretty much.

13
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,800
Do you mind if we take a look at them
 and maybe see how nice you really are?

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,340
Mr. Nice Guy: Uh...Okay.

15
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,320
Great! Here is one: “You shall not lie.”

16
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,280
Mr. Nice Guy, have you ever told a lie?

17
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,880
Mr. Nice Guy: Well, yeah. Who has not?

18
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,520
What do you call somebody who tells lies?

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,780
Mr. Nice Guy: A liar.

20
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,780
Alright. How about another commandment?

21
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,560
“You shall not steal.” 

22
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,120
Have you ever stolen anything, even once?

23
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,180
Mr. Nice Guy: Nope!

24
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,320
But... you just told me you are a liar.

25
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,540
Mr. Nice Guy: Well, I did steal some candy once 
when I was a kid.

26
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,420
And what do you call someone who steals?

27
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:06,993
Mr. Nice Guy: A thief.

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,380
Alright. Let us try another one.

29
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,580
“You shall not commit adultery.”

30
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,760
Oh, that is easy. I would never cheat on my wife.

31
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:14,960
[Music]

32
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,620
Woman: Hi handsome.

33
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,420
Mr. Nice Guy: Oh baby!

34
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,300
[Narrator clears throat]

35
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,720
Jesus said if you even look at a woman with lust,

36
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,340
you have already committed adultery with her in your heart.

37
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,000
Mr. Nice Guy: Oh...um, right.

38
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:31,700
One more.

39
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,440
“You shall not take the name of the LORD
your God in vain.”

40
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,420
Have you ever used God’s name to curse?

41
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,620
[Car crashes]

42
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,540
Mr. Nice Guy: Oh my (beep)!

43
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,520
That, Mr. Nice Guy is called blasphemy.

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,760
God gave you life and breath and everything you have!

45
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,980
And you have dragged His name through the dirt.

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,571
So, by your own admission...

47
00:01:55,571 --> 00:02:00,251
...you are a liar, a thief, a blasphemer, and an adulterer at heart.

48
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,260
And that is just four of the Ten Commandments.

49
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,900
Mr. Nice Guy: Okay okay, so I am not perfect.

50
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,140
Actually, it is worse than that.

51
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,860
Suppose we could put a chip in your brain
that would record all your private thoughts

52
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,980
 for an entire week and then play 
those thoughts on a giant movie screen

53
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,055
 for all your friends and family to see.

54
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:18,715
[Woman faints]

55
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,360
Mr. Nice Guy: That would be embarrassing!

56
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,480
Yeah, I know.

57
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,560
The Bible says God knows everything, 
even the secret thoughts of your heart.

58
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,040
Mr. Nice Guy: Well...

59
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,680
[Scribbles on chalk board]

60
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,440
...compared to some people I am a saint.

61
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,300
[Heavenly choir sings]

62
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,700
That is true. But the standard is 
God’s law, not other people.

63
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,820
[Chalkboard crashes]

64
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:38,860
[Light bulb fails]

65
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,600
Besides, even if you sinned just five times a day

66
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,340
in one year... that is one thousand eight hundred and twenty-five (1825) sins.

67
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,700
And if you live to be seventy years old...

68
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:54,840
...you will have broken God’s law over one hundred and twenty-seven thousand (127000) times!

69
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,200
You will have to answer for every sin 
on Judgement Day,

70
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:03,620
when the Bible says, “Each of us will give
an account of himself to God (Romans 14:12).”

71
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,580
[Mr. Nice Guy gulps]

72
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,660
Mr. Nice Guy: But... God will forgive me. Right?

73
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,560
Well, let us try that in court.

74
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:16,500
Criminal: I know I keep breaking the law, but
can you, you know, let it slide?

75
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,003
Only a corrupt judge would buy (do) that.

76
00:03:19,003 --> 00:03:20,683
A GOOD judge would say...

77
00:03:20,683 --> 00:03:21,503
[Slams his gavel]

78
00:03:21,503 --> 00:03:24,923
Good Judge: Justice demands
that you pay for your crimes.

79
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:25,980
[Criminal gulps]

80
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,860
God is not a corrupt judge.

81
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,900
He is a holy, righteous judge.

82
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,520
 He hates sin!

83
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,800
Jesus warned that on Judgement Day,

84
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,080
everyone who had sinned against God

85
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,159
will justly end up in a terrible place called Hell.

86
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,080
[People screaming]

87
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,420
And there will be no escape for all eternity.

88
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,300
Mr. Nice Guy: Well, then, how can ANYBODY get to Heaven?

89
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,360
There is only one way.

90
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,860
God loved the world so much 

91
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,200
that He sent His Son, Jesus, 

92
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,799
to live a perfect life.

93
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:58,319
He never sinned, not even once.

94
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,420
Then, Jesus offered to take 
the punishment for guilty sinners.

95
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:03,780
He was whipped,

96
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,000
and beaten... 

97
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,560
...and nailed to a cross, and died.

98
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:12,120
so that justice would be served 
and sinners could go free!

99
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,200
Then, Jesus rose from the grave

100
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,620
and defeated death!

101
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,600
You can not earn eternal life.

102
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,320
It is God’s gift...

103
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,820
...to everyone who will humble themselves
 and come to Jesus.

104
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,160
He will forgive you,

105
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:25,860
[Shackles fall]

106
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 wash you clean,

107
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,120
and give you a new heart with new desires

108
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,500
The Bible says, “...if anyone is in Christ, he
is a new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17).”

109
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,880
So stop living for yourself.

110
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,620
Turn from your sins and come to Jesus.

111
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,500
Then, read your Bible and obey it.

112
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,440
Find a good church to help you grow.

113
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,900
And then go out and tell 
other people the good news!

Kirk Cameron: Each week we send out a free ministry
update and it contains a short video clip.

117
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,740
Ray Comfort finds colorful characters, 
he witnesses to them,

118
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,620
and then I ‘chalk talk’ (explain) the clip. 
Here are some samples.

119
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,820
Ray: Do you believe in God? 
Man: Of course!

120
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,680
Man: I believe that God actually learns through us.

121
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,640
Woman: There is a Heaven right here.

122
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,880
Man: Multiple times a day, God hugs me.

123
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,640
Woman: What planet are you living on?

124
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,840
Man: I have no problem standing before the
Lord as I am.

125
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,920
Kirk: After seeing new clips each week,

126
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,980
and understanding the biblical
principles behind them, you will end up saying,

127
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,820
“I could do that!”

128
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,120
There is no charge for
the update.

And we will send it to you every week.

131

Man: For God so loved the world that He gave His only forgotten Son.

132
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,320
Ray: While you are there, check out “The
School of Biblical Evangelism.”
